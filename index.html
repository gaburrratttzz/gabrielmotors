        <h2>Introduction to Motor Engines</h2>
        <p>
            A motor engine is a machine designed to convert various forms of energy into mechanical energy. The most common
            type is the internal combustion engine (ICE), found in most vehicles, which burns fuel to generate power. There are
            also electric motors, which use electrical energy to generate motion.

        <h2>Parts of a Motor Engine</h2>
        <div class="parts-list">
            <div class="part">
                <h3>Cylinder</h3>
                <p>The cylinder is the space where fuel is burned and power is generated. It contains the piston and is crucial for the combustion process.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="part">
                <h3>Piston</h3>
                <p>The piston moves up and down inside the cylinder, transferring the force generated by combustion to the crankshaft.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="part">
                <h3>Crankshaft</h3>
                <p>The crankshaft converts the linear motion of the piston into rotational motion, which powers the vehicle's wheels.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="part">
                <h3>Valves</h3>
                <p>Valves control the flow of fuel and exhaust gases in and out of the cylinders.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="part">
                <h3>Camshaft</h3>
                <p>The camshaft controls the timing of the valves' opening and closing, ensuring proper engine performance.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="part">
                <h3>Fuel Injector</h3>
                <p>Fuel injectors spray fuel directly into the combustion chamber to mix with air for combustion.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

    <section id="types">
        <h2>Types of Motors</h2>
        <h3>1. Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)</h3>
        <p>This type of engine burns fuel (such as gasoline or diesel) inside the engine to produce power. It is commonly used in cars, motorcycles, and trucks.</p>

        <h3>2. Electric Motor</h3>
        <p>Electric motors use electrical energy to create mechanical motion. They are widely used in household appliances, electric vehicles, and industrial machines.</p>

        <h3>3. Hybrid Motor</h3>
        <p>Hybrid engines combine both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor to increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.</p>

        <h3>4. Steam Engine</h3>
        <p>Steam engines use heat to convert water into steam, which drives a piston. Though outdated, they played a critical role in the Industrial Revolution.</p>
